# ingoodcompany.info [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/ingoodcompany.info.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/ingoodcompany.info)

Website to research potential employers, [ingoodcompany.info][]

[findwork.co][] might be shutting down soon. If that's the case, then we'd like to preserve the company research feature elsewhere as we've found its information to be invaluable during past searches (quickly surfaced compatibility information)

[ingoodcompany.info]: https://ingoodcompany.info/
